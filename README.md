# CodeAlpha-Internship-webdevelopment

Welcome to my Web Development Internship Portfolio! This portfolio showcases three projects I have developed during my internship, demonstrating my skills in web development.

Projects
1. Expense Tracker
   
The Expense Tracker is a web application that allows users to track their expenses. Users can add, edit, and delete expenses, and the application calculates and displays the total amount spent. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
